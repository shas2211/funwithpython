Hello guys this is my first repository and first project to upload...  do read the "README" file.


hello there , I am sharath. You can call me as shas. I started my coding life from 1 st year of btech and for some reasons I didnt do anything progressive till 3rd semester. I mastered skills in python which I learnt it from python bootcamp on Udemy platform. Later I started to focus on AI ML topics like Opencv,NLP,machine learning techniques,,,blah blahhhh. SOON i will introduce you to my AURA (ai model integrated with language models ) which speak like a human and yeah it does see you ,observe things, detect faces and what not, but I need a little bit timee to finish it.,,, meanwhile u can meeet my "ZOYA" a personlised AI assistant capable of doing similar things like google assistant, "CHUCK" an AI with machine learning techniques capable of detecting problems in ur body! and i am waiting to bring you my favourite " GLITCH" an AI specially designed for visually impaired persons. I am currently doing research on "GLITCH" and trying to enhance the ... and yeah I know you really wish to see them. I will soon introduce these guys to u....keep waiting.

As it is my first repository, I decided to upload something fun which I made with basic python modules.In this repository u will find few games like snake ,pong and I personally recommend u to look at turtle graphics which make some mind soul satisfying designs....see ya!!
