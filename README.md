Hello there 👾, I am sharath. You can call me "shas". 🤖
As it is my first repository, I decided to upload something fun🤫🤫 which I made with basic python modules.In this repository u will find few games like snake🐍🐍 ,pong⚽ and I personally recommend u to look at turtle graphics which make some mind soul satisfying designs🐢🐢🐢🐢....see ya!!



Before running the files make sure you have the upadates python verison on your pc and downlaod the turtle package in the compiler.(I recommend you to run the files in VScode.)
